**Alexa Porchia's Data Portfolio**

Welcome and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects, with more SQL, Dashboard, and Python projects soon to come. Below you'll find a highlighted project on Hospital Inpatient data, including SQL exploration I performed using PostgreSQL. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any feedback or questions.

**Highlighted Projects**

**Hospital Inpatient Stays (CA & NY 2021) - SQL**: In this project, I used a dataset found on HCUPNET to analyze hospital inpatient ICD code grouping trends in 2021. Using aggregagte hospital charges and number of stays, I examined the cost and count of each ICD code group. I joined data from California and New York to compare the most common and costly diagnoses of 2021.
